Commented example of exported to-do list from webside into txt file
```
Mage:                  <-- category name (ends with ':')
	nw             <-- checked item (one tabulator as prefix)
King's Rest            <-- uncgecked item (no tabulator)
	mechagon
	vault
Dazar Mythic
	tw dung
	tw raid
                       <-- end of category (empty line)
Dudu:                  <-- new category
	tw dung

Pala:
King's Rest
	tw dung
```

### Why? Motivation?
I know that the to-do list is a very basic project that is found in every programming tutorial right after printing ```hello world```. When I was still actively playing MMO RPGs I had a fomo from not completing repeatable quests _(weekly quests)_.
So I needed a tool that would allow me to quickly check which weekly quests I have left for each of my characters in World of Warcraft. Previously I used a simple text editor where I just used a tab to mark completed tasks for each class. But at the end of the week it was always tedious to unmark everything and it was also not very UI friendly. I needed a more efficient _(faster and "nicer")_ tool compatible with my text editor _(hence the import/export)_.

In school I was learning mostly backend and I realized that I had big gaps in html/css and actually javascript. That's why this project was created, I combined the pleasant with the useful. It's still not something very UI friendly, but at least I got to try it out for a purpose and replace a basic text editor with a to-do list on my own site.
